## CREnv

This library is meant as a helper for preparing the cluster state when doing
integration test using https://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/envtest[envtest] and
the Ginkgo + Gomega combo for tests.

It provides the `TestSetup` struct using which one can declare the desired state
that needs to exist prior to starting a test as well as some utility methods
to inspect the cluster state and force reconciliations of objects.
