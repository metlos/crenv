## CREnv

This library is meant as a helper for preparing the cluster state when doing
integration test using https://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/envtest[envtest] and
the Ginkgo + Gomega combo for tests.

It provides the `TestSetup` struct using which one can declare the desired state
that needs to exist prior to starting a test as well as some utility methods
to inspect the cluster state and force reconciliations of objects.

### Usage

#### Basic setup 

In your Ginkgo test, declare the desired cluster state like this:

```go
var _ = Describe("my detailed test", func() {
    testSetup := crenv.TestSetup{
        ToCreate: []client.Object{
            &my.AwesomeCR{
                ObjectMeta: v1.ObjectMeta{
                    Name: "my-obj",
                    Namespace: "default",
                },
            },
        },
    }

    BeforeEach(func() {
        var ctx context.Context = ...
        var cl client.Client = ...
        testSetup.BeforeEach(ctx, cl, nil)
    })

    AfterEach(func() {
        var ctx context.Context = ...
        testSetup.AfterEach(ctx)
    }

    // now you can write your tests
})
```

This might seem as a bit of a mouthful but it comes with some guarantees:

* `BeforeEach` doesn't let the tests run until all objects in `ToCreate` have non-empty status (if they have one at all).
   This means that a reconciliation ran at least once for these objects.
* `AfterEach` deletes all the monitored objects from the cluster (helping with repeatability).

#### Inspecting the cluster

CREnv automatically loads all the monitored objects so that your tests don't need to get resources from the cluster and handle
the potential errors ad nauseam.

```go
It("my test", func() {
    Expect(crenv.GetAll[*my.AwesomeCR](&testSetup.InCluster)).NotTo(BeEmpty())
}
```

There is a couple of methods to find the in-cluster object you need to check in your tests:
* `crenv.Find` - to find an object of given type by its object key.
* `crenv.FindByNamePrefix` - to find an object of given type by its namespace and name prefix.
* `crenv.GetAll` - to get all the objects of given type
* `crenv.First` - one object of given type (for the simple usecases where you expect to have just one object in the cluster)

This should cover the basic needs of the tests but if you need a more elaborate filtering, you can always just read from the cluster directly.

#### Waiting for the cluster to settle

Sometimes, you want to make test some postconditions that should happen as a result of the reconciliation of the custom resource.
```go
It("my test", func() {
    Expect(cl.Update(ctx, myObject)).To(Succeed())
    testSetup.SettleWithCluster(func(g Gomega) {
        newState := crenv.Find[*my.AwesomeCR](&testSetup.InCluster, client.ObjectKeyFromObject(myObject))
        g.Expect(newState.Status.Phase).To(Equal("awesome"))
    })
}
```

At some other times, you may want to actually manually trigger the reconciliation so that the controller does some action.

```go
It("my test", func() {
    testSetup.ReconcileWithCluster(func(g Gomega) {
        newState := crenv.Find[*my.AwesomeCR](&testSetup.InCluster, client.ObjectKeyFromObject(myObject))
        g.Expect(newState.Status.Phase).To(Equal("awesome"))
    })
}
```
This will force the reconciliation by updating a random annotation on all monitored objects and wait for the cluster state to settle again.

#### Making sense of the logs

This library extensively logs (using the `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/log` `FromContext` logger) so that the different stages of the test are
discernible in the logs from the controllers. This becomes extremely useful when debugging problems involving more than one controller and CRD.
